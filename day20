STAAS (Storage As a Service)
Storage Cloud:-
Categories:-

Object Storage:- Ex:- Google Drive, Drop Box, OneDrive
It cannot be formatted in another format type like in NTFS or XFS
More Examples:-
AWS :- S3
Azure :- Blob
OpenStack :- Swift
Block Storage:-
Blank Harddisk or Empty or Raw
Examples:-
AWS :- EBS
Azure :- Azure Disk
OpenStack :- Cinder
EBS (Elastic Block Storage)
CIFS (Common Internet File System) is same like NFS (Network File System) but CIFS is operatable in multiple OS
ScSi (Small Computer System Interface) protocol is used for detecting the attached HDD to the same OS.
iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface) protocol is used for making another system or OS feel that the same HDD is detected in that system.
FCOE (Fiber Channel Over Ethernet) protocol has same usage as IScSi.
EBS used iSCSI in backend.
Pinging self machine

ansible localhost -m ping

O/P:-
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
make a dir in /etc/ansible for playbooks by the name playbooks

Three Sections in Playbook:

Target
Variable
Tasks
Checking the syntax of playbook

ansible-playbook --syntax-check list_hdd.yml
name keyword is just like a comment
register keyword is used for storing the output of upper line command output
debug keyword is used for printing
list_hdd.yml

---
 - hosts: localhost
   tasks:
    - name: listing all attached hard disk in local system
      command: lsblk
      register: x

    - name: printing value of x
      debug: var=x
Minimum and Maximum Limit of EBS Storage is 1GB to 16TB

Snapshot in EBS is a backup at the current time what folder and files are containing and includes all the information just like metadata.
We can create a new EBS by that same Snapshot and new EBS can also have more storage and availabilty zone can also be different, that's why it is called Elastic Block Storage.
EBS [Exam Interview Tips]

Block Storage
Min:- 1 GiB
Difference b/w GB and GiB is
1GB = 1000 MB and 1GiB = 1024 MiB
Max:- 16384 GiB
Can we attach one EBS in more than one EC2 -> According to amazon, NO so answer is NO but we can do it.
Can we take more than 16 GB in one EBS -> Go to Support section for that
Encryption in EBS -> Without encryption, Amazon internal employee can see the data if he/she can. But with encryption, a key will get generated for the whole HDD which is only accessible to the user only. Keys are generated using KMS (Key Management System)
For setting up the aws login using Ansible by the secret keys

aws configure
For aws command not found in Redhat 7.5:-

python2-pip rpm (Search on google and download rpm file and download the rpm using wget in redhat 7.5)
Then

pip install boto3 awscli
Permissions
$ chmod a-rwx file-name # permission for all
permissions to a directory can be given either by root or owner of directory
Task for Non-HTML
on ec2, launch a webserver and /var/www/html/AI here store playbooks
when each playbook is seen on browser, whatever playbook is clicked, it should run
