Day 17
Branching @ Github
Make branches for different categories within ML-Specialisation repo
Data Processing
Computer Vision
Supervised ML
NLP
Neural Network
Deep Learning
By default every repo is initialised with a master branch
every file in master branch or every change in master branch is shown in all branches
Git Commands
git branch - > Shows the no of branches available in repo
git checkout -b branch-name -> used to make new branch and we switch into it
git reset --hard commit-sequence-given-in-log -> used to change the commit state
git push origin branch-name - > push the committed data into given branch name
git checkout branch-name -> change the branch being used
git branch -a - > shows new branches added on repo but didn't recieved on cloning
commit only after coming back to normal time

Notes
to attach new volume in Virtual Box at run time without restarting we use virtIO in storage setting
At AWS , we can attach new volumes without rebooting or stopping the system
$ partprobe -> to resync all HDD in
mount -a -> it runs the fstab file again and mounts the HDD if not mounted
to permit root login on AWS , open /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and set permitrootlogin to yes
lsblk --output=uuid device-name it gives uuid of specific HDD
SSH
ssh ip-address # it logins on other system with same user you are running this command as
ssh stands for Secure Shell
ssh -X root@ip -> used to give graphical interface to virtual box
LVM
LVM stands for Logical Volume Manager
-l extents - > it is used to provide size in terms of extents
lvcreate --name tech -l 30 vg-name
to display the content of lvm in short use lvs
to give a physical extent size to vg group usw -s
vgcreate -s 16M vg-name hdd-name1 hdd-name2
Ansible
cli :- Command Line Interface

sudo pip3 install awscli
for connectivity

sudo pip3 install boto3
pip install boto
for configure for credentials

aws configure

AWS Access Key ID [None]: _KEY_
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: _SECRET_KEY_
Default region name [None]: ap-south-1b
Default output format [None]: json
Default Output format types :- text, json, table

# Data Engineering
  * A classifier requires an accurate data to use its processing algorithm
  * pre-processing of data before applying ML is know as Data Engineering
  * tasks in Data Engineering - >
    1. Clean
    2. Recycle
    3. Auto Fill
  * pandas is similar to SQL and basically creates its own structure called DataFrame
  * Imputer - > replacing missing numerical value with relevant data is done with the help of imputer
  * Data Processing have a branch called Dummy variable
  * Dummy cariable works in a way that it encodes the string into a array format like [1,0,0] where 1 the value in row 1 is flagged as 1 and other as 0 and length of array is equal to number of different values
  * To calculate distance KNN uses distance formula that is
root((x1-x2) + (y1-y2) + (z1-z2))

* Feature Scaling - > it is the method of data where we convert features in the range of each other
e.g., 1 feature has values (27,38,59) and other one has values (10000,239999,38888) so bring both features in similar range this method is applied
* Imputing is a part of Data Mining & Engineering
