Data Analitics class
To draw a scatter chart we use plt.scatter()
To draw a pie chart we use plt.pie()
plt.pie(runs,labels=player,explode=exp,shadow=True,autopct='%1.1%')
plt.grid(color='green')
plt.show()
CSV (Comma Seperated Values)
Pandas is a liberary used for data processing.
To read a csv file in pandas
Here data readed by pandas is called as dataframe.
Data Frame is a structure developed by pandas it converts any type of data to pandas data frame using read_csv.
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('com.csv')
df1 = pd.read_csv('http://13.234.66.67/summer19/datasets/com.csv')
Now if I need to see the structure of use the function df.info()
df.info()
Now If I need to print all the data
print(df)
Now If I say I just need top 3 rows then use head function
df.head(3)
Now If I say I just need bottom 3 rows then use tail function
df.tail(3)
Now if we need a specific column or such you can specify the column name in df
df['Name']
For selecting rows and columns we have a function called
df.iloc[0:,0]
To get max min avg mean value from a column
df['Salary'].max()
df['Salary'].min()
df['Salary'].mean()
df['Salary'].avg()
NumPy Numerical Python
Tensorflow is the advanced version of NumPy.
The data would be atleast in two dimensions and can be in 100's of Dimensions.
To install numpy we use
pip install numpy
To use numpy we import it with a name to short the module name
import numpy as np
We can create array in numpy by calling a function only.
a = np.array([1,2,45,35,45])
We can print an array just by using the variable name or we can print a specific value also.
print(a)
print(a[0])
[ 2  7  1 99  4]
2
We can also perform operations on arrays
a*2
a**2
a+b
We can create multidimensional arrays just by adding list brackets inside the list.
x = np.array([[2,5,8],[3,6,1]])
[[2 5 8]
 [3 6 1]]
Now we have a full table and now we can access it by using matrix row x column
When we use x+7 it basically adds 7 in every element of the array.
If I want a specific row just use the 1st row index in array.
x[0]
[2 5 8]
We can get the shape size or matrix dimensions by calling the shape() function with the matrix variable.
x.shape()
To get specific number of rows we use slicing tool
z[0:5]
Diabetic Data
#from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('http://13.234.66.67/summer19/datasets/diabetest.csv')

now printing schema of data
data.info()

Describing the data
data.describe()

printing original data top 5 columns
data.head(5)

plot a particular column with count using seaborn
import seaborn as sb sb.countplot(data['Pregnancies'])

sb.countplot(df['Glucose'])

data.hist(figsize=(15,20))

sb.pairplot(data)

Extract Attribute from Data Frame
features = data.iloc[:,0:8].values

Extract Label from Data Frame
label = data.iloc[:,8].values label

label.shape

DAY 15
MACHINE LEARNING
Notes
Data is all about business these days
combination of science and data to generate and valuabe data to be used in Business is DATA SCIENCE
Python cannot process more then 10GB data at once
Machine learning is logical analysis of data to accurately do your work
AI is a kind of project management (e.g, autodriving of car)
Matlab is a mixture of numpy,pandas,seaborn,matplotlib
Collection of homogenous values is array
slashlinuxcode.blogspot.com use to study about numpy
Data Science
In this domain we have:
Bigdata -> domain to store and process , very large amount of data
Machine Learning - > an sorted data is taken from bigdata to be used
Machine Learning
A branch in which we teach something to ML and it keeps on learning using logical approach and datasets available to it

it will be a communication between user and machine in the language of maths

Libraries to be used mostly to deal with data and visualize it :

Numpy
Pandas
SeaBorn
Matplotlib
basic data structures used :

list
tuple
for
set
NUMPY
Numerical Python or numpy
library to use numeric data
its advanced version is Tensor Flow
stores and process data in the form of array
Data Processing and Visualization
its better to represent the data in graphical form rather then numerical values
Libraries popularly used for Visualization are:
MPLD3
matplotlib
Seaborn
gnuplot
Dash
MATPLOTLIB
its an open source project and we can be contribute in it
to delete a module which is imported use
del module-name
