Agenda of the DAY

Python Interface - > web - > Desktop Server
CGI
scp -i key user@ip # used to copy data securely from desktop machine to server machine
HTML is designed as an alternative for Microsoft Office, because Microsoft Office is not browsable.
HTML is a documentation language which is used to write documentation.
A HTML page is accessible world wide via internet.
A Webpage is 100% document
We can create HTML pages with .htm, .html.
To change a page every 7 seconds
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="7;url=http://google.com">
When we dont need to open a new page and the working will be on the same page
We will use iframe
Python Backend CGI
To communicate Apache with Python we have a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) for this.
CGI is used to provide connectivity to programming language with Apache server.
Writing our 1st CGI File
It is necessary to give path of the python interpreter path
#!/usr/bin/python3
We need to disable Selinux before using our webpage.
setenforceing 0
We can permanently disable Selinux vai /etc/selinux/config
Now we need to import CGI for our use.
CGITB is used to display errors on the webpage and error log. CGITB full form Common Gateway Interface Trace Back.
import cgi
import cgitb
Now we need to enable cgitb
cgitb.enable()
We need to write two lines neccessarily to use python as backend
print("Content-type:text/html")
print("")
To get root access in CGI we have to make apache user as sudo user.
To add apache as sudo user open the file in /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users and this line in it.
apache ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
To use cgi-bin in Debian distribution like ubuntu you have to tell the apache to give access to cgi-bin.
As such to enable cgi-bin use the command
a2enmod cgi
The default cgi-bin path in ubuntu is /usr/lib/cgi-bin
Things to explore about OS
Windows 2016 Server
Redhat
Ubuntu
Open SUSE
Using Subprocess module
To run a linux or windows command in python we use subprocess.
import subprocess
result = subprocess.getoutput("date")
Webpage is just a kind of document with format or extension of HTML
DNS is a server that stores the ip of all servers and websites mapped with some name
DVWA -> software which is able to hack a website and if open or installed on system then it will be able to access all files in system
developer.mozilla.org - > website to practice with website development
Software Requirements
httpd
empty page of a html file shows the ip of server or title.
HTML
<marquee> text </marquee> # used make text movable

<meta http-quiv="refresh" content="number-of-seconds;url=path-of-url" /> # to open different page with user interaction after certain time

<!-- comment data -->

<iframe src="path-of-url"> </iframe>

in src , we can type the url,img,video-name of anything to play

to run shellinabox

<iframe src='ip-of-server:4200' width="456" height="475"> </iframe>
<input name='' > # to take input from user
<form> </form> # to use form
while submitting a form, the variable collects the ip,port,mac,OS-type of the machine being used
HTML is a kind of document language
Processing html data using CGI
while using forms, the data submitted by user is transferred to aws server by the html using http protocol and this work of communicating with the user and passing the data to backend program is reffered as front-end language
CGI stands for Common Gateway Interface , it is a driver which is used to act as a gateway or communication medium between backend language and apache
the backend code of CGI is stored in /var/www/cgi-bin
telnet is a service used to connect with any ip and with any protocol
telnet ip-address port-no
CGI file need to be given execution permission
SELINUX need to be disabled
To install apache in ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install apache2
```
* to use cgi , make directory in /usr/lib/cgi-bin
* run command ```a2enmod cgi``` to activate cgi
* run command ```systemctl restart apache2``` to restart services
To get root access
* make apache a sudoer
* move to ```/etc/sudoers.d/```
* write this in last
```
apache ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```
* save it with ```:wq!``` to save it at run time
To learn about OS
* practice on Windows 2016
* practice redhat , ubuntu/debian
* practice opensuse
HTML is a upgraded version of MS Office but it is browsable
refresh the page after 3 seconds to the given URL; 3= no. of seconds

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3" ;url=https://www.google.com />
For comment in html

CGI = Common Gateway Interface => Its is driver user for integrating(communication) between backend(Python, JAVA) and Apache Server

Remove the color of the terminal output

unalias ls
Making backend:-

/var/www/cgi-bin

cmd.cgi

#!/usr/bin/python3

import cgi
import cgitb
# to show common error in webbrowser
cgitb.enable()

print("Content-type:text/html")
print("")

webdata=cgi.FieldStorage() # this will collect all the html code with data

# Now extracting value of x
data=webdata.getvalue('x')

# Sending output to client via web server
print(data)

chmod +x cmd.cgi
Always set selinux to disabled for CGI
setting up the html file for CGI

<FORM action="/cgi-bin/cmd.cgi">

</FORM>
For seeing the error

tailf /var/log/httpd/error_log
For inserting the command of terminal in text box [insert code in same file as previous]

import subprocess

output=subprocess.getoutput(data)
print(output)
for inserting any output into a HTML tag

import subprocess

output=subprocess.getoutput(data)
print("<h1>")
print(output)
print("</h1>")
for not showing the data of variable in URL

<Form method="POST">

</form>
pre tag shows the original format of command output

print("<pre>")
print(output)
print("</pre>")
For executing sudo commands with CGI:-

cd /etc/sudoers.d/

vi 90-cloud-init-users

add this command in file for making apache a sudo user

apache ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
For installing apache in UBUNTU

apt-get install apache2
activate CGI for UBUNTU only

a2enmod cgi
Tasks
Why we cannot open google.com in iframe
And how we can do this the same for our page
Use the iframe to drag and drop the iframe
The iframe should allow to resize the window
