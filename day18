NFS
Server
for ubuntu ( sudo apt-get install kernel-nfs-server)
for rhel ( sudo yum install nfs-utils )
Create a directory to use as nfs ( mkdir /shareable-directory)
vi /etc/exports directory-path ip-to-allow-to-connect(rw or ro,no_root_squash)
exportfs -r # it makes all files shareable on server, basically reloads the exports file
chmod 757 directory-path
showmount -e ip-of-server ( All traffic should be open )
Client
showmount -e server-ip
mount server-ip:directory-path directory-path-to-mount-on
entry in fstab
source-ip:directory-path where-to-mount nfs _netdev 0 0
Ansible
Install Ansible by
yum install ansible.noarch -y
or

pip install ansible
In background , ansible uses SSH protocol (open ssh server) to connect and work over each system thus every system must have ssh installed and configured
In hosts file of ansible that is /etc/ansible/hosts we can use normal public IP address or public DNS to connect with hosts
To work from a user while not using the default configuring files,
Copy the ansible configuration file /etc/ansible/ansible.conf to users home directory
Create a hosts file to enter the entry of targets ip-address
To disable the ssh host key checkup , open the config file and set host_key_checking = False
To create a file using ansible
ansible localhost -m file -a "path=directory-path state=directory mode=0755"
to learn about any ansible module
ansible-doc module-name
to see what happens in background while using ansible use
ansible adhoc-command -vvv
ifconfig br0: ifnet is the private ip lancard of ethernet is eno1 lancard of wifi is wl bridgecard is br0 in exam many things are configured on br0
Fixing an IP is termed as static ip
Setting up static IP
ping ip-address -> check if ip is working properly
ping server-name (if not possible then set in resolv.conf )
set ip
cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
name of file in this directory should be ifcfg-lan_card_name example ifcfg-eth0
vi ifcfg-etho
change BOOTPROTO="static"
NAME = "lan-card-name"
ONBOOT = "yes"
in last line
IPADDR= 192.168.10.43
DNS=192.168.10.254 (server will be given,name-server/domain-name-server)
NETMASK= 255.255.255.0 - > single public ip (can be taken from ifconfig)
GATEWAY= 192.168.10.1     (ip to communicates with outside world)
route -n # shows the values of kernel ip routing table
0.0.0.0 means anywhere
after configuration, reboot which must show the set ip
resolv.conf - > gives ip from name
after setting static ip
open /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver ip-address-of-eth0
Ansible
For Ansible, Linux machine is required
Inventory:-

Static
Dynamic
Localhost user is used through ansible and ping command is used; -m= module include which is ping here

 ansible localhost -m ping

 O/P:-
 localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
ansible all -m ping -u ec2-user
File module; -a= for argument pass

ansible localhost -m file -a "path=/root/naman state=directory mode=755"
shell module = For running the shell commands through ansible; -vvv= shows the working of backend in terminal

ansible localhost -m shell -a "date" -vvv
