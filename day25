Required content we should know before working for NAAS

IP Address
NetMask
Subnet
Gateway
DNS
Router
Switch
DHCP
Firewall
NAT
Routing Table
##IP address = 192.168.10.101 192.168.10 = network address .101= host ip

Network address and netmask should be same to in connect with any device wired or wireless.
##Netmask : how to find netmask

ip address = __ . __ . __ .__ there are four parts in ip address so we find netmask through part 1 of IP address
netmask=

part 1 range 1-127 (class A) netmask =255.0.0.0
Part 1 range 128-191 (class B) Netmask =255.255.0.0
part 1 range 192-223 (class C)
Netmask =255.255.255.0
SubNet
192.168.10.0 Part 4 - 1byte = 8 bit = 2power(8)=0-255 =256 ip

so we can create 2 or more network from a single ip we divide part 4

network 1 =192.168.10.0 to 192.168.10.126

network 2 =192.168.10.127 to 192.168.10.255

Subnet
if netmask = 255.255.255.0 we can directly write netmask with if ip l 192.168.10.194/24 so 24 is netmask and called prifix length

if netmask is 255.255.255.0 subnet = ip/24
if netmask is 255.255.0.0 subnet = ip/16
if netmask is 255.0.0.0 subnet = ip/8
Gateway
To go outside your network to connect with other ip address like google we like to connect then the path we need to connect with it

router
help to connect two different IP address device

Switch
Help to connect many devices in same network. switch is advance version of Bridge

DNS
Definition of: DNS. DNS. (Domain Name System) The Internet's system for converting alphabetic names into numeric IP addresses. For example, when a Web address (URL) is typed into a browser, DNS servers return the IP address of the Web server associated with that name.

if we have 1000 device and have to give unique ip address to individual device where dhcp do this work.
DHCP
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on UDP/IP networks whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks.
Firewall
In computing, a firewall is software or firmware that enforces a set of rules about what data packets will be allowed to enter or leave a network. Firewalls are incorporated into a wide variety of networked devices to filter traffic and lower the risk that malicious packets traveling over the public internet can impact the security of a private network. Firewalls may also be purchased as stand-alone software applications.

NAT
all of us private ip converted into public ip process known as NAT. Stands for "Network Address Translation." NAT translates the IP addresses of computers in a local network to a single IP address. This address is often used by the router that connects the computers to the Internet.

Routing Table
if want to go out of current network gateway is used so through routing table we write the path to go uut for selected devices where this is written the path is Routing table.

VPC
When we create a default VPC, we do the following to set it up for you:

Create a VPC with a size /16 IPv4 CIDR block (172.31.0.0/16). This provides up to 65,536 private IPv4 addresses.

Create a size /20 default subnet in each Availability Zone. This provides up to 4,096 addresses per subnet, a few of which are reserved for our use.

Create an internet gateway and connect it to your default VPC.

Create a default security group and associate it with your default VPC.

Create a default network access control list (ACL) and associate it with your default VPC.

Associate the default DHCP options set for your AWS account with your default VPC.
